            <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a motivated and curious learner with a background in IT Support, Service Delivery and BC/DR solutions. I've always loved understanding how things work, whether it's fixing a tricky tech issue or polishing a piece of metal until it gleams. Now, I'm channeling that same curiosity and determination into programming.

            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <p>
                When I’m not exploring the world of code, you can find me enjoying a good gin and tonic, or playing online survival games with friends. I enjoy challenges that make me think, and I’m equally at home in creative and logical problem-solving spaces. I am also interested in learning woodwork and metal polishing. (I'm still trying to figure out a way to combine these interests with my coding interests).

            <h2>Why I'm Excited About This Bootcamp</h2>
            <p>
                To me, coding gives you the ability to turn ideas into something real, that can help, entertain, or inspire others. I’m excited to join this bootcamp because I know it will push me to grow, connect me with like-minded people, and give me the tools I need to bring my ideas to life. I’m ready to take the next steps and develop my coding career, and hopefully have some fun along the way!
